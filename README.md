## App Brainstorming
**Twitter**
 * Very concise comparing to those all-in-one apps.
 * The scrolling is smooth and logic is simple.
 * Overall a great social media app despite it's becoming more and more complex with more bugs after becoming Xü§£
**Apple Music**
 * Also like twitter, it's a light app with focused functionalities.
 * Very nice UI and UX design. Not too fancy and it's easy to get started.
 * No ads is a big plus.
**Amex**
 * The UI design is more modern than some other financial apps like BoA.
 * The loading of pages is quite fast.
 * Have't found any bugs.
**Gmail**
 * Simple and easy to use.
 * The UX design is much better than Microsoft products. I cannot quantify the experience but I'm just feeling smooth when using Google apps comparing to MSFT apps.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
