Submitted by: **Mingyi Gao**

**Random Color Generator** is an app that can change its background color randomly when you click the "Change" button.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [‚úîÔ∏è] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming
**Twitter**
 * Very concise compared to those all-in-one apps.
 * The scrolling is smooth and logic is simple.
 * Overall, it's a great social media app, although it's becoming increasingly complex and bug-prone, especially after becoming X.ü§£

**Apple Music**
 * Similar to Twitter, it's a lightweight app with focused functionalities.
 * The UI and UX design are very nice - not too fancy, and it's easy to get started.
 * No ads is a big plus.

**Amex**
 * Its UI design is more modern compared to other financial apps like BoA.
 * The loading of pages is quite fast.
 * I have't found any bugs.

**Gmail**
 * Simple and easy to use.
 * The UX design is much better than that of Microsoft products. I can't quantify the experience, but using Google apps feels smoother compared to Microsoft apps.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a problem connecting a button to logic. At first I did't create an `@IBAction`, so it did't function as expected. After I deleted the old one and correctly created an `@IBAction`, it encountered an error. Initially, I was stuck. After thoroughly going through the guide, I realized that the error might be caused by the connection - the old code was deleted, but its connection was still there. So I deleted the old connection in the Connection Inspector. Finally, it ran without errors or bugs and it's functioning as expected.
